# A list of Sensu checks that will run on the overcloud hosts. The
# only required key for each item is `name`. The systemd `service`
# used in `systemctl` checks defaults to `openstack-<name>`, and the
# `subscribers` key defaults to `[ "overcloud-<name>" ]`.
#
# The following checks are disabled because the corresponding services
# are run as WSGI applications under Apache.  This means that we don't
# have a good client-side healthcheck until we make changes either to
# sensu packaging or our tripleo integration.
