# ------------------------------------------
# High-level hostgroups
#
# Add hosts to these groups (ideally by creating an additional inventory
# file in the inventory directory, rather than editing this file) to
# set up typical groups of services.
#
# You should keep an order of something like this:
# host_name ansible_host=ip_address ansible_user=user

[am_hosts]
# Availability monitoring

[pm_hosts]
# Performance monitoring

[logging_hosts]
# Logging

# ------------------------------------------
# Low-level hostgroups
#
# Add hosts to these groups for more granular control of service placement.
# If you are using these low-level hostgroups, you should not add hosts to
# any of the high-level hostgroups.
